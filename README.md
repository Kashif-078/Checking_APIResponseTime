**API Response Time Test with Cypress**
This repository contains a Cypress test suite designed to evaluate the response times of various API endpoints using the jsonplaceholder.typicode.com JSONPlaceholder API. The tests focus on GET, POST, and PUT requests, and provide insights into the performance of different API interactions.

**Test Cases**
**The test suite includes the following scenarios:**

**GET API Response Time Test:**
This test examines the response times of various GET API endpoints. It logs any endpoints that have a response time exceeding 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and provides visibility into potentially slow APIs.

**POST API Response Time Test:** 
The POST test sends multiple POST requests with distinct request bodies to the /posts endpoint. It assesses the response times of these requests, logs any slow API calls, and provides insights into the performance of the POST endpoints.

**PUT API Response Time Test:** 
Similar to the POST test, the PUT test sends PUT requests to update existing posts on the API. It verifies the response times of these requests, logs any slow responses, and offers a glimpse into the performance of the PUT endpoints.

**Usage**
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Node.js and Cypress installed.
Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Open Cypress using npx cypress open.
Click on the desired test file (api_response_time_spec.js) to run the API response time tests.
Observe the test execution and review the console output for information on slow API responses.

**Note**
The tests utilize the jsonplaceholder.typicode.com API as the testing endpoint. You can modify the test data, request bodies, or endpoints to suit your specific use case.
